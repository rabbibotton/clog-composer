The CLOG Composer is a tool that will assist you to design from scratch,
manage and monitor software projects.

Programming is a pain, so let's make it easier on the programmers
--- this is at the very heart of Lisp philosophy.
("Lisp philosophy" TANAKA Tomoyuki)

Unlike other tools designed to create more work for the developer to create
metrics for managers, CLOG Composer helps inspire, organize and monitor to
allow for faster development, a more robust product and offer better
communications to the entire team and enterpise.

The Composer is written in the Common Lisp Omnificent GUI, CLOG for short, so
run any where and on just about anything.
