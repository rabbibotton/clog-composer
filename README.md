The CLOG Composer is a tool that will assist you to design from scratch,
manage and monitor software projects.

The world is a symphony of patterns, identifying them is near prophecy.
(David Botton)

Unlike other tools designed to create more work for the developer to create
metrics for managers, CLOG Composer helps inspire, organize and monitor to
allow for faster development, a more robust product and offer better
communications to the entire team and enterpise.

The heart of the composer is using process patterns to reduce the complexity
of software development. Process patterns are creative patterns,
software development patterns, and deployment/monitoring patters.

The Composer is written in the Common Lisp Omnificent GUI, CLOG for short, so
it will run on almost any OS and any device.

The Composer is part of CLOG's Common Lisp tool suite however much of the
system will assist any project in any language and not only software projects.

Key Patterns Behind the Composer

Place + Time = Consistency
Your Narrative is your Reality and What you will be
  Review of narratives
  Truth of narratives
  Identify where the narrative goes next
  Rewrite you narrative and reality often if needed
Anxiety not knowing what to do next
Boredom is an addiction
  Boredom plans a cure
Hacking the process is a procrastination in and of itself
Questions force your brain to find answers
Best ideas require interaction with others
Iterations are about closer to excellence not perfection
