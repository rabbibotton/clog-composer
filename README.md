The CLOG Composer is a tool that will assist you to design from scratch,
manage and monitor software projects.

The world is a symphony of patterns, identifying them is near prophecy.
(David Botton)

Unlike other tools designed to create more work for the developer to create
metrics for managers, CLOG Composer helps inspire, organize and monitor to
allow for faster development, a more robust product and offer better
communications to the entire team and enterpise.

The heart of the composer is using process patterns to reduce the complexity
of software development. Process patterns are creative patterns,
software development patterns, and deployment/monitoring patters.

The Composer is written in the Common Lisp Omnificent GUI, CLOG for short, so
it will run on almost any OS and any device.

The Composer is part of CLOG's Common Lisp tool suite however much of the
system will assist any project in any language.
